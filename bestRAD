BestRAD Library Preparation for 96-samples

Based on protocol of Ali et al. 2015 (10.1534/genetics.115.183665)

Updated by BVH March 13, 2018

ADAPTED BY AEW July 6, 2021 to match concentrations from previous protocol







This is a 3-day protocol

(Although it could be completed in 2 long days).

There are designated stopping points. Please adhere to them!




Section 1: DNA Standardization

1.	Standardize your high quality genomic DNA with 125ng in 10uL (ie. 12.5ng/uL) in a 96 well plate.

2.	All DNA will also have needed to be run out on a gel to survey level (if any) of degradation and shearing. Aim to pool samples of similar quality together.

¨	80% ethanol freshly made from 100% Molecular Grade ethanol (ThermoFisher Scientific BP82021)

o  For total 5ml: 4mL of 100% ethanol, 1 mL molecular grade water

¨	1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
¨	Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) mixed and at room temperature for at least 1 hour, and Magnetic Rack
¨	Low TE (TE0.1: 10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA).

1.	Pool 5uL from each uniquely indexed sample from columns 1-6, and pool separately columns 7-12 into 8 well PCR strips. Then transfer all volume from each strip tube into their respective 1.5mL tube for a total volume of 192uL per pool. This will give you 2 tubes per 96-samples, each tubed consists of 48 uniquely barcoded samples. Freeze the rest in case you need to come back to it!

2.	Clean the DNA with 1 X Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881).

a.	Add 480 uL Agencourt AMPure Beads to each tube. Gently mix by pipetting and quick spin.

b.	Incubate the sample at room temperature for 5 minutes to bind DNA to the beads.

c.	Place the tube on a magnetic rack (LIDS CLOSED) and wait until the liquid is clear to capture the beads (10 minutes).

d.	With tube on rack, carefully open lids, remove and discard the supernatant (in hazardous waste because beads are stored in sodium azide).

e.	Keep the tube on the rack and add 960 uL (cover beads) freshly made 80% ethanol to wash the beads.

f.	Incubate at room temperature for 30 – 60 seconds.
g.	Leave tube on rack; carefully remove ethanol & discard.

h.	Repeat steps e – g again. Remove the residual ethanol with a small pipette tip. Do not disturb beads.

i.	Dry the beads at room temperature for about 5 minutes. Do not overdry the beads.

j.	Close lids and remove the tubes from the magnetic rack.

k.	Add 210 uL Low TE. Mix by pipetting and quick spin.

Section 5: Sonication to Selected Size Fragment Materials Required

¨	Bioanalyzer (if desired)
¨	Sonicator in Roberts Lab


1.	Verify that the Sonicator water tank is filled with distilled water to the “full line”.
2.	Turn on water bath of Sonicator and allow to cool to 4C (this takes ~1 hour)
3.	Balance the Sonicator rack with “blank tubes” containing the same volume of liquid as your sample (use MilliQ H20 for “blank tubes”).
4.	Shear 20 cycles of [30 sec on; 59 sec off]
5.	Run 1uL on BioAnalyzer to asses shearing efficiency: reshear if necessary. DNA fragments should be distributed between 300-600 bp. 




Additional Optional Step: You can check shearing efficiency using the BioAnalyzer on one of your samples at this point to ensure the correct sample size. Place 3ul in a 1.5mL tube and deposit in the Core Receiving Fridge. Shearing at 400 bp is important for downstream workflow.

REAGENTS LIST

Low TE (TE0.1: 10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA)

Materials:

o	Molecular Grade Water o 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) o 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0)
To make 100 mL of Low TE, remove 1.02 mL (1 mL plus 20 uL) from a 100 mL

bottle of Molecular Grade Water. Then add 1 mL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 20 uL 0.5M EDTA. Mix by inversion. It is also probably fine to just dilute regular 1X TE in a
1:9 ratio with molecular grade water. But then you end up with 1mM Tris-HCl and

0.1 mM EDTA. It is the EDTA concentration that is the most important here.

80% Ethanol

Materials:

o	96% Molecular Grade Ethanol (Fisher BP82021) o Molecular Grade Water (Fisher BP2484100)

o  5mL tubes or 15 mL conical tubes
Make this fresh each day you are doing a bead clean up or size selection.

Mix 4.167 mL of 96% ethanol with 0.833 mL of molecular grade water.

2X Binding and Wash Buffer

Reagent	C1	V1 (uL)	C2 (mM)	V2 (uL
1M Tris HCl pH 7.5	1000	100	10	100000
0.5M EDTA pH 7.5	500	20	1	100000
5M NaCl	5000	4000	2	100000
Molecular Grade Water		5880		

0.1% Tween EB

Materials:

o	Tween 20 (Fisher BP337-100) o EB Buffer (Qiagen 19086)

Tween is really viscous so it is difficult to pipette 1 uL accurately. So, first make a 10% solution with the 100-1000 uL pipette: Eg. mix 1 mL of Tween 20 with 9 mL Buffer EB. Then make a 0.1% Tween EB solution by combining 100 uL of 10% Tween EB with 9900 uL of EB Buffer. This gives you 0.1% Tween EB.
